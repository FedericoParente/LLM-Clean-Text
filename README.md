## LLM Clean Text: Unicode to ASCII Converter

**Clean, Simplify, Make Your Text Compatible.**

LLM Clean Text is a simple and free web application designed to convert Unicode text into pure ASCII. Its main purpose is to ‚Äúclean‚Äù the text by removing or transliterating special characters, accents, and especially those invisible Unicode characters that may be inserted by Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT or other sources, causing formatting or compatibility issues.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Smart Transliteration**: Automatically converts common punctuation (e.g. smart quotes, long dashes) and Latin accents into their standard ASCII equivalents (e.g. ‚Äú to ", √© to e).
* **Invisible Character Removal**: Removes non-printable or zero-width Unicode characters.
* **Full Cleanup**: Strips out any other non-ASCII characters (e.g. Cyrillic, Chinese, Arabic) that can't be transliterated.
* **Simple UI**: An intuitive interface to paste input and immediately see the ASCII output.
* **Live Stats**: Displays original character count, ASCII output count, and how many characters were removed.
* **Practical Tools**: Copy the cleaned output to clipboard or download as a `.txt` file with one click.

## üí° Why Use It?

Text generated by LLMs or copied from various online sources may contain a wide range of Unicode characters that, while valid, are not always compatible with all systems, databases, or applications that require plain ASCII text.

### Common Issues:

* **Invisible ‚ÄúWatermarks‚Äù**: Some LLMs insert invisible character patterns for tracking purposes.
* **Formatting Problems**: Characters like zero-width spaces (U+200B) can break layouts or cause unexpected line breaks.
* **Legacy System Incompatibility**: Many older systems or programming environments only support ASCII.
* **Data Cleaning**: Ideal for preparing text for analysis, logging, or data pipelines that benefit from standardized input.

LLM Clean Text ensures your text is clean, predictable, and universally compatible.

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Visit the App**: Open the LLM Clean Text web application.
2. **Paste Your Text**: Insert your Unicode text into the "Input (Unicode)" area.
3. **View the Output**: The ASCII output will appear instantly in the "Output (ASCII)" area.
4. **Copy or Download**: Use the "Copy" or "Download" buttons as needed.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (Technical Details)

The core logic is in the `transliterateToASCII` function. Key steps:

1. **Unicode Normalization (NFD)**: Decomposes accented characters (e.g. √© ‚Üí e + ÃÅ).
2. **Basic Replacements**: Uses a predefined `basicReplacements` map to replace common Unicode punctuation.
3. **Diacritic Removal**: Removes all combining marks.
4. **Non-ASCII Removal**: Eliminates anything outside `\x00-\x7F` range.
5. **Space and Line Normalization**: Collapses excessive whitespace and standardizes newlines.
6. **Final Trim**: Trims trailing spaces per line and overall.

This function is reusable and suitable for server-side or other use cases.
